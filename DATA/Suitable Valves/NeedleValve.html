			Needle valves are linear motion valves which are used in systems for control of small volumes where continuous throttling is required for the flow regulation. Needle valves are somewhat similar to globe valves in design with the biggest difference being their sharp needle-like disk.

		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Suitable for isolation.</li>
			<li>Suitable for control.</li>
			<li>Suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/SafetyReliefValves.html>relief.</a></li>
			<li>Suitable for chemical applications.</li>
			<li>Generally, low operational costs.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Not suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/ThreeWayValves.html>diversion.</a></li>
			<li>High resistance to flow.</li>
			<li>Slow actuation.</li>
			<li>Not suitable for use as a check valve.</li>
			<li>Not suitable for slurry applications.</li>
			<li>Generally, high capital costs.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Additional Information
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Very precise control achieved as a result of the fine geometry.</li>
			<li>This same fine geometry causes significant resistance to flow.</li>
			<li>Although suitable for isolation, larger systems can achieve this in more economical ways.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Needle valves are actuated by linear or multi-turn actuators. This could be <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/PneumaticActuators.html>pneumatic</a> or <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/HydraulicActuators.html>hydraulic</a> using a piston or a diaphragm. Linear actuation is also possible using <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ElectricActuators.html>electric</a> and <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ManualActuators.html>manual</a> actuators. This could be manual through the use of a multi-turn hand-wheel, or electric using a motor and gear box attached to a rack and pinion or scotch yolk to convert between rotational and linear motion.
