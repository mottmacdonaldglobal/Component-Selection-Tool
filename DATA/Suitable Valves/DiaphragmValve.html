		<p>
			Diaphragm valves are flex-body valves in which the valve body consists of a rigid and flexible section. The flexible body section is provided by a diaphragm which, in connection with a compressor, represents the closure member. The seat is provided by the rigid body section and may consist of a weir across the flow passage or be provided by the wall of a straight-through flow passage.

		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Not suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/SafetyReliefValves.html>relief.</a></li>

			<li>Generally, high capital and operational costs associated with diaphragm valves.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Additional Information
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Diaphragm valves are particularly useful in sanitary applications as the fluid is isolated from the actuating mechanism via the flexible diaphragm. This isolation makes diaphragm valves leak-proof and easy to maintain.</li>
			<li>Diaphragm valves (like pinch valves) should not be used as shut-off valves in systems where incompressible fluids have nowhere to go. Use in this manner may cause damage to the system due to elevated pressures.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Alternative Contruction / Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Weir / Saddle
		</h3>
		<p>
			The weir in the flow passage is designed to reduce flexing of the diaphragm to a minimum, while still providing a smooth and streamlined flow passage. The flexing stress in the diaphragm is therefore minimal, resulting in a correspondingly long diaphragm life. 
		<h3>
			Straight-through / Full-bore
		</h3>
		<p>
			Diaphragm valves with a straight-through flow passage require a more flexible diaphragm than weir-type diaphragm valves. For this reason, the construction material for diaphragms of straight-through diaphragm valves is restricted to elastomers.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Diaphragm valves are actuated by linear or multi-turn actuators. This could be <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/PneumaticActuators.html>pneumatic</a> or <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/HydraulicActuators.html>hydraulic</a> using a piston or a diaphragm. Linear actuation is also possible using <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ElectricActuators.html>electric</a> and <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ManualActuators.html>manual</a> actuators. This could be manual through the use of a multi-turn hand-wheel, or electric using a motor and gear box attached to a rack and pinion or scotch yolk to convert between rotational and linear motion.
