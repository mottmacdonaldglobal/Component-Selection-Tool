			<p>
				A ball valve is a shut off valve that controls the flow of a liquid or gas by means of a rotary ball with a bore. By rotating the ball a quarter turn (90 degrees) around its axis, the medium can flow through or is blocked.
			</p>
			<p>
				In special versions, ball valves are also used as a control valve. This application is less common due to the relatively limited accuracy of controlling the flow rate in comparison with other types of control valves.

		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Suitable for isolation.</li>
			<li>Suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/ThreeWayValves.html>diversion.</a></li>
			<li>Quarter turn actuation makes ball valves particularly fast acting.</li>
			<li>"Straight-through" geometry provides little resistance to flow, hence, minimal pressure drop across the valve. This geometric characteristic makes ball valves suitable in high flow applications.</li>
			<li>Suitable for chemical applications.</li>
			<li>Generally, low capital and operational costs associated with ball valves.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Not suitable for control due to cavitation. Resulting wear on the ball can cause leakage.</li>
			<li>Not suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/SafetyReliefValves.html>relief.</a></li>
			<li>Not suitable for use as a check valve.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Alternative Contruction / Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Segmented Ball Valve
		</h3>
		<p>
			Similar in principle to the traditional ball valve, however, segmented ball valves have a V-shaped notch. A segmented ball valve has good flow rate control which depends on the ball rotation and increased performance with slurries.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Ball valves are actuated by quarter-turn, rotary actuators. This could be <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ManualActuators.html>manual</a> through the use of a hand-wheel or basic lever, or <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ElectricActuators.html>electric</a> using a motor and gear box. Rotational actuation is also possible using <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/PneumaticActuators.html>pneumatic</a> and <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/HydraulicActuators.html>hydraulic</a> actuators. This could be a piston or a diaphragm connected to a rack and pinion or scotch yoke to convert linear to rotational motion.
