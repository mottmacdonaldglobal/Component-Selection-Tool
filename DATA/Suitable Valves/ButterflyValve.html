		<p>
			Butterfly valves are quarter-turn rotary valves in which a disc-shaped closure member is rotated through 90 degree or less to open or close or regulate the flow passage. Butterfly valves may be used for flow in both directions. Unlike a ball valve, the disc is always present within the flow, therefore a pressure drop is always induced, regardless of valve position.

		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Suitable for control.</li>
			<li>Suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/ThreeWayValves.html>diversion.</a></li>
			<li>Quarter turn actuation makes butterfly valves particularly fast acting.</li>
			<li>"Straight-through" geometry provides little resistance to flow, hence, minimal pressure drop across the valve. This geometric characteristic makes butterfly valves suitable in high flow applications.</li>
			<li>Suitable for chemical applications.</li>
			<li>Suitable for slurry applications.</li>
			<li>Generally, low capital and operational costs associated with butterfly valves.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Not suitable for isolation.</li>
			<li>Not suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/SafetyReliefValves.html>relief.</a></li>
			<li>High torque required to actuate valve under high flow conditions.</li>
			<li>Not suitable for use as a check valve.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Alternative Contruction / Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Inflatable seal
		</h3>
		<p>
			This type of butterfly valve uses an inflatable seal to generate a tighter seal than traditional butterfly valves. The disc is moved into the tapered seat with the hose deflated so that the seating torque is minimal. The hose is then pressurised to provide a fluid-tight seal against the seat.
		<h3>
			Lined
		</h3>
		<p>
			Lined butterfly valves use a liner to help the valve generate a solid seal between the disc and body. Where the inflatable seal butterfly valve has this flexible seal located on the disc, the lined butterfly valve has its flexible material located within the valve body. For most butterfly valves, this liner will likely be made of a flexible elastomer.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Lug style
		</h3>
		<p>
			The lug-style butterfly valve has threaded lugs outside the valve body. Two sets of bolts connect pipe flanges to each side of the bolt inserts without nuts. This design enables the disconnection of one side without affecting the other for dead-end service. Lug-style butterfly valves used in dead end service generally have a lower pressure rating.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Wafer style
		</h3>
		<p>
			A wafer-style butterfly valve is the most economical version and it is sandwiched between two pipe flanges and the flange bolts surround the valve body.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Butterfly valves are actuated by quarter-turn, rotary actuators. This could be <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ManualActuators.html>manual</a> through the use of a hand-wheel or basic lever, or <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ElectricActuators.html>electric</a> using a motor and gear box. Rotational actuation is also possible using <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/PneumaticActuators.html>pneumatic</a> and <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/HydraulicActuators.html>hydraulic</a> actuators. This could be a piston or a diaphragm connected to a rack and pinion or scotch yoke to convert linear to rotational motion.
