		<p>
			Plug valves are rotary valves in which a plug-shaped closure member is rotated through increments of 90Â° to engage or disengage a porthole or holes in the plug with the ports in the valve body. The shape of the plug may thereby be cylindrical or tapered.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Suitable for isolation.</li>
			<li>Suitable for control.</li>
			<li>Suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/ThreeWayValves.html>diversion.</a></li>
			<li>Fast actuation.</li>
			<li>Suitable for chemical applications.</li>
			<li>Some variations may be suitable for slurry applications.</li>
			<li>Generally, low capital and operational costs.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Not suitable for <a href = ../Specialist%20Valves/SafetyReliefValves.html>relief.</a></li>
			<li>Not suitable for use as a check valve.</li>
			<li>High resistance to flow.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Additional Information
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list">
			<li>Plug valves are very similar in operation to ball valves.</li>
			<li>Fast acting due to their quarter turn actuation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Alternative Contruction / Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Eccentric
		</h3>
		<p>
			Eccentric plug valves, like segmented ball valves, display greater performance than their traditional counterparts for application with solid suspensions and slurries. They also provide increased control compared with traditional plug / ball valves.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Lubricated
		</h3>
		<p>
			Lubricated plug valves use a lubricating material to provide the seal between mechanisms and the fluid. This lubricant can often be topped up through a port on the valve when levels get too low.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Non-lubricated
		</h3>
		<p>
			Where lubricated plug valves use a lubricant to provide a seal between mechanisms and the fluid, non-lubricated plug valves are solely reliant on a polymetric sleeve for sealing. Non-lubricated plug valves perform better under extreme temperature conditions where the lubricant might otherwise freeze or evaporate.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Various port geometries
		</h3>
		<p>
			The port of a plug valve is the gap through which the fluid flows. This can take the form of a variety of geometries. Some examples include: Diamond, Rectangular, or Round.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Plug valves are actuated by quarter-turn, rotary actuators. This could be <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ManualActuators.html>manual</a> through the use of a hand-wheel or basic lever, or <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/ElectricActuators.html>electric</a> using a motor and gear box. Rotational actuation is also possible using <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/PneumaticActuators.html>pneumatic</a> and <a href = ../Valve%20Actuators/HydraulicActuators.html>hydraulic</a> actuators. This could be a piston or a diaphragm connected to a rack and pinion or scotch yoke to convert linear to rotational motion.
