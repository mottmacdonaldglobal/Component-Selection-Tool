		<h2>
			Positive Displacement Pumps
		</h2>
		<p>
			In positive displacement pumps, the liquid is forced to move because it is displaced by the movement of a piston, vane, screw, or roller. The pumps force liquid into the system regardless of the resistance that may oppose the transfer. It is particularly important therefore, to consider to the wider pumping system and safety requirements, particularly the potential need for relief valves to avoid over pressurisation of the system when using positive displacement pumps.
		</p>
		<p>
			Positive displacement pumps generally carry a higher overall efficiency than centrifugal pumps because internal losses are minimised.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Rotary Pumps
		</h2>
		<p>
			Rotary pumps are a category of positive displacement pumps consisting of a chamber that contains gears, cams, screws, lobes, plungers, or similar devices actuated by rotation of the drive shaft. These valves feature no separate inlet and outlet valves and run with tight clearances. Typical applications include:
		</p>
		<ul id="the-list2">
			<li>Refrigeration, heating and air conditioning</li>
			<li>Food and beverages</li>
			<li>Pulp and paper</li>
			<li>Chemical</li>
			<li>Sewage treatment</li>
			<li>Manufacturing</li>
			<li>Water supply</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Information
		</h2>
		<p>
			This pump utilises vanes in the form of blades, buckets, rollers, or slippers, which act in conjunction with a cam to draw liquid into and force it from the pump chamber.
		</p>
		<p>
			A vane pump may be constructed with vanes in either the rotor or stator and with radial hydraulic forces on the rotor balanced or unbalanced. The vane in rotor pumps may be made with constant or variable displacement pumping elements.

		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id="the-list2">
			<li>High efficiency.</li>
			<li>Contamination free due to the absense of lubrication.</li>
			<li>Low maintenance requirements.</li>
			<li>Quiet running.</li>
			<li>Steady fluid flow.</li>
			<li>Ideal for gases and vapours.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Alternative Contruction / Configuration
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Unbalanced Vane Pump
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is the most common type of vane pump and features an offset rotor. This generates a lateral thrust on the shaft which shortens the bearing life.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Balanced Vane Pump
		</h3>
		<p>
			Balanced rotary vane pumps feature a circular rotor centred within an elliptical casing. Typically, this pump would be configured with two inlets and two outlets located at opposite sides for each other. As a result, the shaft faces no lateral force, prolonging the life of the bearing compared with unbalanced vane pumps.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Variable Displacement Pump
		</h3>
		<p>
			This type of vane pump uses a spring and adjustable screw to vary the pocket size and hence the flow rate from the pump.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Pump Sizing
		</h2>
		<p>
			Selecting an appropriate pump type is the first step, after which, the pump must be appropriately sized for the particular application. This requires significant understanding of the wider pumping system, particularly to establish the required pump duty.

			Several industry tools exist to aid in pump sizing using the above inputs. One such useful tool by Xylect is linked <a href = https://www.xylect.com/bin/Xylect.dll?IS__NEXTPAGE=startup&IS__NEXTPAGE=BDYHOME&IS__AREA=GREAT%20BRITAIN&IS__COUNTRY=UNITED%20KINGDOM&IS__BROWSER=%23%23%23958%23959>here.</a> Additionally, the following <a href = ../PumpCalcs.html>spreadsheet</a> may be particularly helpful in establishing the aforementioned inputs.
