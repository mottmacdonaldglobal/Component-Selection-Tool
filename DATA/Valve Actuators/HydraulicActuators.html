		<h2>
			Actuator Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Methods of valve actuation fall into one of the following categories:
		</p>
		<p>
			1.Linear
		</p>
		<p>
			2.Part-turn
		</p>
		<p>
			3.Multi-turn
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of the above methods can be powered by one of the following sources:
		</p>
		<p>
			1.Hydraulic
		</p>
		<p>
			2.Electric
		</p>
		<p>
			3.Pneumatic
		</p>
		<h3>
			Rotary Actuators
		</h3>
		<p>
			Rotary actuators vary in terms of actuator torque and range of motion. Depending on the valve’s design, the stem may rise during rotation or without rotation. Common ranges of motion include 90-degree (part-turn), 180-, 270-, and 360-degree (multi-turn). As such, rotary actuators may be used for valves such as ball, plug and butterfly.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Linear Actuators
		</h3>
		<p>
			Linear valve actuators differ in terms of valve stem stroke length, number of turns, and actuator force or seating thrust. The term stroke is used to define the travel required to have the valve fully opened to fully closed. Using an actuator with fewer strokes than the valve will "short stroke" the valve and the full control volume rating of the valve will not be realised.
		</p>
		<p>
			Linear actuators are used to actuate valves such as gate, globe and diaphragm valves.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Hydraulic Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hydraulic actuators are capable of delivering very high torques, and with it the fast-stroking speed necessary to operate larger valves. They offer stiffness in the stroke, because they are using what is considered to be a non-compressible liquid. Hydraulic actuators are used for these characteristics  when, for certain reasons, pneumatic or electric motors are either not suitable or not available.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hydraulic actuators are available as double acting or spring return, similar to pneumatic actuators and the pressure is supplied by means of a hydraulic pump. This power source can be supplied either locally by a power pack, or remotely with the hydraulic fluid transferred through smallbore tubing. The pressure of the hydraulic fluid can be varied to supply different torque outputs. This allows for more flexibility of energy sources and subsequent outputs than is available with both electric and pneumatic actuators.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id=the-list2>
			<li>Well suited for high force applications.</li>
			<li>Can hold force and torque constant without the need for additional fluid supply.</li>
			<li>Pumps and motors can be located a considerable distance away with minimal loss of power.</li>
			<li>The operation of the above components may require noise reduction equipment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id=the-list2>
			<li>Hydraulic fluid may leak leading to loss of efficiency and potential for damage to surrounding components.</li>
			<li>Hydraulic actuators require many complementary parts such as a fluid resevoir, motor, pump, release valves and heat exchaner.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Failsafe Function
		</h2>
		<p>
			The principles of operation of a hydraulic actuator are like those of the pneumatic actuator. Each uses some motive force to overcome spring force to move the valve. This allows hydraulic actuators to be designed to fail-open or fail-close depending on their use case.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Addtional Considerations
		</h2>
		<p>
			The actuator  must deliver enough torque to move  and  seat the valvewith  the  minimum  power  supply  available  and  also  maintain  the required position (open, closed, or intermediate) under the worst  flowconditions that the valve might experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  actuator  must  be  capable  of  completing  the travel,  that  is, 90°,180°, and multi-turn  at the required  speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  actuator  must  include  a  device  that  prevents  excessive  forcesbeing applied to the valve under adverse power  supply conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The actuators fail-safe position must be considered and appropriate systems put in place to facilitate this.
