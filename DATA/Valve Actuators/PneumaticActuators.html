		<h2>
			Actuator Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Methods of valve actuation fall into one of the following categories:
		</p>
		<p>
			1.Linear
		</p>
		<p>
			2.Part-turn
		</p>
		<p>
			3.Multi-turn
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of the above methods can be powered by one of the following sources:
		</p>
		<p>
			1.Hydraulic
		</p>
		<p>
			2.Electric
		</p>
		<p>
			3.Pneumatic
		</p>
		<h3>
			Rotary Actuators
		</h3>
		<p>
			Rotary actuators vary in terms of actuator torque and range of motion. Depending on the valve’s design, the stem may rise during rotation or without rotation. Common ranges of motion include 90-degree (part-turn), 180-, 270-, and 360-degree (multi-turn). As such, rotary actuators may be used for valves such as ball, plug and butterfly.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Linear Actuators
		</h3>
		<p>
			Linear valve actuators differ in terms of valve stem stroke length, number of turns, and actuator force or seating thrust. The term stroke is used to define the travel required to have the valve fully opened to fully closed. Using an actuator with fewer strokes than the valve will "short stroke" the valve and the full control volume rating of the valve will not be realised.
		</p>
		<p>
			Linear actuators are used to actuate valves such as gate, globe and diaphragm valves.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Pneumatic Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Pneumatic supply is generally compressed dry air, but designs are also available for natural gas. Compressor and accumulator design is a consideration when designing a network of pneumatically operated actuators to achieve an efficient system. Valve operating times are also a significant factor when determining the pneumatic capacity of the supply and the size of the tubing.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id=the-list2>
			<li>Spring design allows easy fail-safe control.</li>
			<li>High force and speed.</li>
			<li>System delay generates resistance to small fluctuations.</li>
			<li>Suitable for hazzardous and explosive environments.</li>
			<li>Low cost of components.</li>
			<li>Relatively small footprint compared with hydraulic actuation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id=the-list2>
			<li>High operational costs.</li>
			<li>Power requirement for compressor system is much greater than that required for electrical actuation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Failsafe Function
		</h2>
		<p>
			The principles of operation of a pneumatic actuator are like those of the hydraulic actuator. Each uses some motive force to overcome spring force to move the valve. This allows hydraulic actuators to be designed to fail-open or fail-close depending on their use case.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Addtional Considerations
		</h2>
		<p>
			The actuator  must deliver enough torque to move  and  seat the valvewith  the  minimum  power  supply  available  and  also  maintain  the required position (open, closed, or intermediate) under the worst  flowconditions that the valve might experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  actuator  must  be  capable  of  completing  the travel,  that  is, 90°,180°, and multi-turn  at the required  speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  actuator  must  include  a  device  that  prevents  excessive  forcesbeing applied to the valve under adverse power  supply conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The actuators fail-safe position must be considered and appropriate systems put in place to facilitate this.
