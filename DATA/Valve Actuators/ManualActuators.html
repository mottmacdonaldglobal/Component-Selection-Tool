		<h2>
			Actuator Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Methods of valve actuation fall into one of the following categories:
		</p>
		<p>
			1.Linear
		</p>
		<p>
			2.Part-turn
		</p>
		<p>
			3.Multi-turn
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of the above methods can be powered by one of the following sources:
		</p>
		<p>
			1.Hydraulic
		</p>
		<p>
			2.Electric
		</p>
		<p>
			3.Pneumatic
		</p>
		<h3>
			Rotary Actuators
		</h3>
		<p>
			Rotary actuators vary in terms of actuator torque and range of motion. Depending on the valve’s design, the stem may rise during rotation or without rotation. Common ranges of motion include 90-degree (part-turn), 180-, 270-, and 360-degree (multi-turn). As such, rotary actuators may be used for valves such as ball, plug and butterfly.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Linear Actuators
		</h3>
		<p>
			Linear valve actuators differ in terms of valve stem stroke length, number of turns, and actuator force or seating thrust. The term stroke is used to define the travel required to have the valve fully opened to fully closed. Using an actuator with fewer strokes than the valve will "short stroke" the valve and the full control volume rating of the valve will not be realised.
		</p>
		<p>
			Linear actuators are used to actuate valves such as gate, globe and diaphragm valves.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Manual Actuation
		</h2>
		<p>
			Manual valve actuators do not require an outside power source to move a valve to a desired position. Instead, they use a handwheel, chainwheel, lever, or declutchable mechanism to drive a series of gears whose ratio results in a higher output torque compared to the input (manual) torque. Most manual valve actuators use worm gears, mechanical devices that transmit motion between non-intersecting right-angle axes.

			Advantages
		</h2>
		<ul id=the-list2>
			<li>Inexpensive.</li>
			<li>Reliable.</li>
			<li>Do not require a power source.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Disadvantages
		</h2>
		<ul id=the-list2>
			<li>Cannot be automated and require manual control.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Failsafe Function
		</h2>
		<p>
			By there very nature, there is little which can fail on a manual valve actuator. For this reason, they tend not to require failsafe mechanisms and instead find common use as failsafes / over-rides for other valve actuators.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Addtional Considerations
		</h2>
		<p>
			The actuator  must deliver enough torque to move  and  seat the valvewith  the  minimum  power  supply  available  and  also  maintain  the required position (open, closed, or intermediate) under the worst  flowconditions that the valve might experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  actuator  must  be  capable  of  completing  the travel,  that  is, 90°,180°, and multi-turn  at the required  speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  actuator  must  include  a  device  that  prevents  excessive  forcesbeing applied to the valve under adverse power  supply conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The actuators fail-safe position must be considered and appropriate systems put in place to facilitate this.
