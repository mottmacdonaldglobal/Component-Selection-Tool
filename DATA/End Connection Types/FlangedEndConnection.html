			Flanged valves are perhaps the most widely used. Flanges are used to mate valves with adjacent piping and/or equipment.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Information
		</h2>
		<p>
			Flanged end connections are tightened by a number of bolts which individually require less tightening torque than an individual threaded joint for a given application. For this very reason flanged end connections can be used for most valve sizes, pressures and temperatures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Flanges are usually installed on valves larger than DN50 (2’’). For sizes smaller than DN50 (2’’), threaded-type valves are typically used, depending on the application and safety considerations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main advantage of using a flanged valve is that the valve can be easily removed from the line. However, it should be noted that flanges are subject to thermal distortion and shock. Therefore a welded connection would usually be recommended for applications where significant temperature variations occur.
