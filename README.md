## About The Project

This tool has been developed to aid engineers in component selection with a focus on pump, valve and actuator applications in mechanical and process environments. 

This is not intended as a fool-proof tool. Instead, significant engineering judgement must be applied in order to make suitable component selection.

## Operation

This tool acts as a library of information with which users can make informed component selection. In the case of valves, users can specify input parameters based on the provided checkboxes to refine the list of suitable valves from which they might make their selection.
